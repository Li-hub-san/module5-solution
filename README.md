**Sumary**
<br>The front page of the web app contains 3 clickable tiles: Menu, Specials, and Map.
<br>By clicking on the Specials tile, you are taken to a single category page where all the menu items that belong to the Specials menu category are shown.
<br>The task consists in altering this behavior in order that by clicking on the Specials tile, the web app takes the user to a random single category menu page, listing menu items in the category: "Lunch", "Dinner", "Sushi", etc.
<br>That way, any random category can become the Specials!

1. Create a container folder `module5-solution` &#10003;
2. Download the starter files into `module5-solution` &#10003;
3. Copy all the contents of the `fullstack-course4/assignments/assignment5/assignment5-solution-starter` folder into `module5-solution` &#10003;
4. Changing the `home-snippet.html` file is NOT allowed &#10003;
5. Any adjustments to the value of `randomCategoryShortName` property can only be done in Javascript code &#10003;
6. Follow the TODO instructions in the `js/script.js` file:
   1. Step 0: Look over the code from start to finish &#10003;
   2. Step 1: Substitute [...] with the *value* of the function *buildAndShowHomeHTML* so it can be called when server responds with the categories data &#10003;
   3. Step 2: Call *chooseRandomCategory*, passing it retrieved 'categories' &#10003;
   4. Step 3: Substitute *{{randomCategoryShortName}}* in the home html snippet with the chosen category from step 2 &#10003;
   5. Step 4: Insert the produced HTML in step 3 into the main page &#10003;
7. Verify that the desired functionality is working correctly:
    1. Load the home page in the browser &#10003;
    2. Click on the Specials tile &#10003;
    3. Different single page category is shown &#10003;
    4. Click on the restaurant logo to go back to the home page &#10003;
    5. Most of the time a different single category page is shown &#10003;
8. Deploy your solution to GitHub pages &#10003;
